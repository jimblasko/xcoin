    To maximize staking yield, combine your inputs after receiving a stake for 0.01 +fees
    0.01+fee reward means your inputs have split too much (or your input is too small). Send your coins back to your self to combine your inputs so you can have a bigger input. If you are staking a small amount of coins you will get this low reward too because the input is too small.
